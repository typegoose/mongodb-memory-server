title: 'Supported Systems'
---

Currently Supported platforms:
<!--Platfrom taken from "MongoBinaryDownloadUrl.get*"-->
- `win32` / `windows`
- `macos` / `osx` / `darwin`
- `linux`

Officially Supported Architectures:
<!--Platfrom taken from "MongoBinaryDownloadUrl.translateArch"-->
- `x64` / `x86_64`
- `arm64` / `aarch64` (only some linux distros have binaries)

:::note
On systems that have native arch translation (like ARM MacOS), the architecture will need to be overwritten with `MONGOMS_ARCH=x64`.

Legend:

- <span class="badge badge--success">Supported</span> means that it is supported by mongodb natively or is a distro that is based on a supported distro.
- <span class="badge badge--warning">Untested</span> means that it is not tested on hardware and so not verified to work.
- <span class="badge badge--warning">Outdated</span> means that the current mappings for MMS are outdated and may not have proper tests.
- <span class="badge badge--danger">Unsupported</span> means that it is unsupported by MMS *and* mongodb.
- <span class="badge badge--secondary">Working</span> means that it is supported by MMS but not by mongodb natively and not based on a supported distro.

## Windows

<span class="badge badge--success">Supported</span>

Should just work out of the box

## MacOS

<span class="badge badge--success">Supported</span>

On x64 systems, it should work right out of the box<br/>
Since Mongodb 6.0.0, they have `arm64` binaries<br/>
Uses `arm64` binaries for all versions above or equal to `6.0.0`, for older versions falls back to using `x86_64` binaries (requires Rosetta)<br/>
Usage of the `x86_64` binary can be forced with [`MONGOMS_ARCH=x64`](../api/config-options.md#arch) (or equal in `package.json`)

## Linux

Depends on the distribution, many common ones should just work right out of the box

### Ubuntu (and based on systems)

<span class="badge badge--success">Supported</span>

(uses mongodb's `ubuntu` release)<br/>
Lowest supported Distribution version is `1404`<br/>
Highest version is `2404` (higher versions will be clamped to this value)<br/>
Default version is `2204`<br/>
Architectures Supported: `x86_64`, `arm64`(`aarch64`)

:::note
Lower Versions than `2004` may be used if mongodb dosnt provide binaries for an lower version of mongodb for an higher version of ubuntu
:::
:::note
Since Mongodb `6.0.4` there are binaries for `2204`, any version before is mapped to `2004` (or earlier) and will require `libssl1.1` to be installed.  
See [this mongodb issue](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-62300).
:::

### Debian

<span class="badge badge--success">Supported</span>

(uses mongodb's `debian` release)<br/>
Lowest supported Distribution version is `71`<br/>
Highest version is `12` (higher versions will be clamped to this value)<br/>
Default version is `12` (when in `unstable` or `testing`, otherwise none)

### Fedora

<span class="badge badge--success">Supported</span>

(uses mongodb's `rhel` release)<br/>
Lowest supported Distribution version is `6`<br/>
Highest version is `36` (see note) (higher versions will be clamped to this value)<br/>
Default version is `34` (when above or equal to `34`, otherwise none)

:::note
Fedora 36 and onwards dont ship openssl1.1 anymore by default and currently needs to be manually installed.  
There are currently no newer mongodb builds that support the newer provided openssl.
:::

### Rhel

<span class="badge badge--warning">Untested</span>

(uses mongodb's `rhel` release)<br/>
Lowest supported Distribution version is `5`<br/>
Highest version is `9` (higher versions will be clamped to this value)<br/>
Default version is `70`<br/>
Architectures Supported: `x86_64`, `arm64`(`aarch64`)

:::note
`arm64`/`aarch64` support is only for Rhel 8.2 & mongodb 4.4.2 or Rhel 9 & mongodb 6.0.7
:::

### Amazon

<span class="badge badge--success">Supported</span>

(uses mongodb's `amazon` release)<br/>
Lowest supported Distribution version is `1`<br/>
Highest version is `2`<br/>
Default version is `1`

### ElementaryOS

<span class="badge badge--warning">Untested</span> <span class="badge badge--warning">Outdated</span>

(uses mongodb's `ubuntu` release)<br/>
Lowest supported Distribution version is `3` (or `0.3`)<br/>
Highest version is `7`<br/>
Default version is `7`

### Linux Mint

<span class="badge badge--success">Supported</span>

(uses mongodb's `ubuntu` release)<br/>
Lowest supported Distribution version is `17`<br/>
Highest version is `22`<br/>
Default version is `21`

### Suse

<span class="badge badge--warning">Untested</span> <span class="badge badge--warning">Outdated</span>

(uses mongodb's `suse` release)<br/>
Lowest supported Distribution version is `11`<br/>
Highest version is `12`<br/>
Default version is none

### Arch

<span class="badge badge--danger">Unsupported</span> <span class="badge badge--secondary">Working</span>

There are no official mongodb builds for Arch Distributions, but the `ubuntu` binaries work on most Arch systems, so they are used.<br/>
Currently Mapping to: `ubuntu2204`

:::note
Because Arch* dosnt base on ubuntu, there is no specific ubuntu version associated with an arch version, so it defaults to highest supported `ubuntu` version
:::
:::note
MongoDB Binary versions before `6.0.4` require OpenSSL 1.1 installed, on arch can be installed via `core/openssl-1.1`.
:::

### Gentoo

<span class="badge badge--danger">Unsupported</span> <span class="badge badge--secondary">Working</span>

There are no official mongodb builds for Gentoo Distributions, but the `debian` binaries work on most Gentoo systems, so they are used.<br/>
Currently Mapping to: `debain11`

:::note
Because Gentoo dosnt base on debian, there is no specific debian version associated with an gentoo version, so it defaults to highest supported `debian` version
:::

### Alpine

<span class="badge badge--danger">Unsupported</span>

There are no official mongodb builds alpine, though there are some unoffical build of mongodb build for it which can be used

### NixOS

<span class="badge badge--danger">Unsupported</span>

There are no official mongodb builds for NixOS, however some users report the ubuntu binaries work with some extra configuration on NixOS, see [Issue #782](https://github.com/typegoose/mongodb-memory-server/issues/782)
